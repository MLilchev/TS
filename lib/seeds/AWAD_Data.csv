Storms formed within an environment of very unstable air and very strong vertical wind shear in advance of an approaching cold front with assistance from an approaching upper level disturbance. Severe storms occurred across the Brush Country during the evening. The storms congealed into a squall line late in the evening. Large hail and winds of at least 60 mph were observed with several of these storms across the Brush Country. During the early morning hours on March 29th, the squall line intensified as it advanced into the Coastal Bend and the Victoria area. Widespread winds between 40 and 60 mph were observed behind the squall line during this time. Sufficient low level shear in the lowest several thousand feet existed to produce mesovortices along the squall line. Several of these mesovortices produced tornadoes across the Coastal Bend during the early morning hours.",An EF-1 tornado touched down in north part of the community of Seadrift on Oakland Avenue and traveled to the east-northeast to North 3rd Street. The tornado flipped several mobile homes and completely destroyed one mobile home near the intersection of West Denver Avenue and North 4th Street. A truck and boat were capsized. Several homes experienced roof damage and several outbuildings were damaged or destroyed. Eight homes were destroyed with one home sustaining major damage and two homes receiving minor damage. Estimated peak wind from the tornado was 110 mph.,CSV

Several homes were damaged by the falling trees. The tornado proceeded eastward across Websters Road and Broughton Road with scattered tree damage. As the tornado crossed Old Sulphur Springs Road, two homes were damaged with scores of trees snapped or uprooted. At Angel Station Road, the tornado filled the valley from one side to the other and caused extensive tree and home damage. An electrical transmission tower line was toppled at this point, but it was believed that flying debris compromised the structure. The tornado continued eastward and destroyed the sanctuary at West Point Baptist Church. Additional structures were severely damaged at the church. The tornado entered the City of Jacksonville where it gained strength into the EF3 category, with winds around 140 mph. It removed most of the roof and the top floor of two buildings in an apartment complex. The tornado affected the entire campus of Jacksonville State University. Several buildings sustained significant damage. The most intense winds remained north of the campus however, mowing down trees and causing direct damage to homes. As the tornado crossed Highway 21, it caused caused major damage to the Merrill Building. It then moved into a highly populated zone, where scores of homes suffered major damage and rendered uninhabitable. The tornado maintained its strength as it crossed Choccolocco Mountain, and winds funneled up the valley uprooting or snapping trees. It caused major damage to a number of homes on the mountainside. Damaged continued all the way up to just south of the peak of the mountain. As the tornado moved down the eastern side of Choccolocco Mountain, it narrowed substantially and became stronger once it reached the valley below. Stands of trees were wiped out with trunks snapped relatively close to ground level. Perhaps the most intense damage along the entire track occurred along Hollingsworth Road, where a site built home was completely destroyed with only a portion of one interior wall left standing. Debris from this home was blown downstream across a field with some evidence of wind rowing. Hay bales adjacent to the home, estimated at 800 pounds each, were thrown up to 300 yards to the east. Maximum winds at this location were estimated at 150 mph. The tornado continued east-southeast and downed thousands of trees in the Talladega National Forest and crossed into Cleburne County just south of County Road 534.",CSV

An environment favorable for significant severe thunderstorms developed as a low-amplitude upper-level trough moved into the region with a deepening surface low passing across far north Alabama.  These two features resulted in a deep column of strong wind shear with 0-6km Bulk Shear values of 60-70 knots. Additionally, moist southerly flow, warm surface temperatures, and colder temperatures aloft yielded a moderately unstable air mass. Initially, thunderstorms were producing large to very large hail. However, the tornado threat increased in the late afternoon and evening hours as wind speeds at low levels increased with the arrival of a low-level jet.","National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Cleburne County  and determined that the damage was consistent with an EF1  tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 100 mph.

Three brief EF-0 tornadoes also occurred. The storms from Grand Island to Columbus formed along a slow-moving cold front.

Intense convection that developed right on top of the boundary generated several tornadoes, with a few occurring simultaneously, especially across extreme southeast Washington County. Most of the tornadoes touched down in open fields and produced just minor crop damage. The heaviest damage occurred in Cope, in southeast Washington County, from an EF-1 tornado.  It caused extensive damage to a carport and garage on the southeast side of town, and downed some trees. The storms also produced hail up to the size of tennis balls in Washington County.
