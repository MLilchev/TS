0,121603,48,Severe thunderstorms occurred along a dryline and cold front.
1,121701,48,"A deep upper level trough moved out of the Inter Mountain West and into the Southern Plains on January 21st. This trough allowed for the return of much warmer temperatures and a return of Gulf of Mexico moisture, replacing a cold continental arctic air mass the Southern Plains had been under the influence of the week before. By afternoon, dewpoints were in the lower 60s as far north as the Middle Red River Valley of Northeast Texas, Southeast Oklahoma and Southwest Arkansas. This yielded CAPE values around 500 J/KG but very strong Deep Layer Shear was present along with strong low level directional shear. Storms ignited during the late afternoon and early evening hours of January 21st across Northern Texas and Southern Oklahoma along and just ahead of a dryline. Later in the evening, low level directional shear continued to increase and therefore, storms took on the form of supercells. Some of these storms produced large hail and damaging wind gusts. One long track supercell resulted in a tornado which did damage across portions of Bowie County Texas before crossing the Red River and continuing into Little River County Arkansas. The Pacific cold front in association with the upper level trough eventually caught up with the dryline moving into Northeast Texas and Southeast Oklahoma during the overnight hours of January 21st and into the predawn hours of January 22nd, but this broken line of thunderstorms was not responsible for any additional wind damage, hail, or tornadoes across Northeast Texas."

3,121716,29,Isolated severe thunderstorms produced a few reports of wind damage and a brief EF-1 tornado.
4,121726,5,"During the early morning hours on Sunday 1/21, a line of severe thunderstorms in the form of a quasi linear convective system (QLCS) moved through the state of Arkansas. Damaging wind was recorded from western Arkansas to Pine Bluff, with a single EF1 tornado in the LZK warning area. Additionally, there was a single report of hail in far western Arkansas."
5,121885,5,Strong to severe thunderstorms developed during the afternoon hours of the 21st over eastern Oklahoma as a cold front moved into the area from the west. These storms moved into northwestern Arkansas during the evening. Two tornadoes and damaging wind gusts occurred across Sebastian and Franklin Counties with the stronger storms.
6,121962,28,"Showers and thunderstorms developed as a cold front pushed through the region. Some of these storms produced hail, damaging wind gusts, flash flooding, and one tornado."
7,122042,6,"An upper-level storm system moved east across northwest California, resulting in high elevation snow, coastal hail, and a tornado."
8,122095,6,High pressure brought a prolonged period of unseasonably warm temperatures to begin February as temperatures were 10 degrees or more above seasonal normals across much of the are for the first 10 days of the month. A low pressure system dropping into the Great Basin on the 10th brought a period of increased winds to the Kern County Mountains and Deserts during the late morning and early afternoon as strong mid level winds mixed down to the surface where there were numerous reports of gusts between 45 and 50 mph. Another trough pushed through the Great Basin on the evening of the 11th through the morning of the 12th which pushed a cold front through Central California and brought another period of increased winds to the area and there were several reports of wind gusts between 50 and 55 mp in the Kern County Mountains and Deserts. this system also brought some light precipitation to the area with amounts generally less than a tenth of an inch of liquid precipitation in post-frontal showers on the 12th. A weak tornado briefly touched down in rural farmland near Sanger during the late morning of the 12th.
9,122115,28,Heavy rain developed across portions of the region in association with a cold front. Some of this heavy rain produced flash flooding. A weak tornado also touched down in Neshoba County.
10,122345,39,"Strong to severe thunderstorms, with very heavy rainfall, developed ahead of a cold front."
11,122346,1,A series of mini-supercells with little or no lightning developed during the late afternoon hours across portions of northwest and north central Alabama south of the Tennessee River.  One of these produced a brief tornado in Cullman County.
12,122457,28,Showers and storms developed in the afternoon ahead of a cold front. Some of these storms produced hail and damaging winds during the late afternoon and early evening across west central Mississippi.
13,122458,22,Showers and storms developed in the afternoon ahead of a cold front. Some of these storms produced hail and a tornado during the late afternoon and early evening across northeast Louisiana.
14,122497,1,"For the first time since January 2017, an event including both flooding and tornadoes impacted our area starting on February 11, 2018. Two tornadoes touched down across inland portions of the Florida Panhandle before sunrise, followed by persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding at several river sites.  One of the tornadoes clipped far southern Houston county.  As an upper level trough dug southward across the western and central U.S., southerly flow drew moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the tri-state area over the weekend. Upper air soundings measured this increased moisture with precipitable water values around 1.5 inches on Sunday, well above the 90th percentile and a record for the 12z February 11 sounding, although the record for that date and time are below the average max for this time of year. With a cold front and upper level trough west of the area, the persistent deep layer moisture helped to create a favorable set-up for high rainfall amounts.  This wet pattern resulted in copious amounts of rainfall across the tri-state region. The highest rainfall amounts were across the Florida Panhandle where 8 to 10 inches fell with localized areas receiving more than 10 inches across coastal Walton and Bay counties. The highest observed rainfall total was in Walton County, where a 48-hour rainfall total of 11.45 inches was recorded. Across southeast Alabama and portions of southwest Georgia, widespread 6 to 8 inches of rain fell. While one Flash Flood Warning was issued, the majority of the impacts from this event were from moderate rainfall rates over a prolonged period of time as convection trained across the tri-state area. These high rainfall totals resulted in numerous road closures across the Florida Panhandle from water covered roads and washed out roadways. In addition, a few roads were closed across southeast Alabama."

16,122610,21,"A stalled frontal boundary interacting with highly anomalous moisture from the Gulf of Mexico interacted with multiple weather systems that brought widespread heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms to central Kentucky February 24 through the early morning hours February 25. A Flash Flood Emergency was issued for Jefferson County, KY including Louisville metro. There were over 50 water rescues alone in Jefferson County that evening. Widespread flash flooding occurred with most streams and creeks reaching record levels. ||In addition, across south central Kentucky, 7 tornadoes developed along a warm front during the afternoon and evening hours. The strongest tornado was an EF-2 that tracked over 11 miles in Logan County and tragically killed a woman in her home. As a squall line moved through during the late evening and early morning hours, damaging winds occurred across central Kentucky."
17,122622,51,Scattered severe thunderstorms in advance of low pressure and a cold front produced damaging winds and one tornado across portions of central and south central Virginia.
18,122701,48,"A upper level low developed across the far NE Texas Panhandle with an associated dryline back to the south and southwest. A jet streak working into west Texas during the afternoon helped bring strong shear throughout the column into the Panhandles. In particular, noticeable surface based directional shear right along the dry line, west winds to the west and east winds east of the dryline helped storms develop rotation along the converging boundary. Storms that developed had broad rotation along a small line of individual couplets. Some deeper cores did produce some severe hail across the northeastern Panhandles. A landspout was confirmed by spotters in far southeast Ochiltree County along with an  6 mile weak EF-1 tornado track through parts of Hemphill and Lipscomb counties."
19,122704,47,"Thunderstorms developed ahead of an upper level system and surface cold front during the evening hours. Several of these storms produced large hail and wind damage. Funnel clouds were reported as a discrete supercell thunderstorm developed over Southeast Tennessee and moved into Southwest North Carolina. As this supercell moved into Monroe County, Tennessee, a weak tornado developed downing several trees and producing minor structural damage."
20,122706,37,"Thunderstorms developed ahead of an upper level system and surface cold front during the evening hours. Several of these storms produced large hail and wind damage. Funnel clouds were reported as a discrete supercell thunderstorm developed over Southeast Tennessee and moved into Southwest North Carolina. As this supercell moved into Monroe County, Tennessee, a weak tornado developed downing several trees and producing minor structural damage."
21,122773,1,"An isolated supercell produced hail during the early afternoon hours across far northwest and north central Alabama. By mid afternoon, a cluster of supercells developed in northern Mississippi and tracked east-southeast through much of north Alabama through the early evening hours. Two main supercell clusters produced multiple tornadoes and very large hail. Tornadoes ranged in strength from EF-0 to EF-2.  The largest hail fell in Cullman County, with widespread and severe damage reported as a result.  The largest hail stone reported to the National Weather Service was 5.25 inches in diameter weighing 8.9 ounces."
22,122774,47,"Most of the tornadic supercell activity asssociated with this event occurred just south of the Tennessee/Alabama state line. However, one of the supercells produced a tornado in Franklin County during the early evening hours."
23,122785,21,"An outbreak of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes occurred across western Kentucky. Most of the severe weather was along and south of a Paducah to Madisonville line. North of that line, serious flash flooding resulted in a fatality. A surface low pressure center tracked rapidly north-northeast from Arkansas to the upper Mississippi Valley, dragging a warm front north across western Kentucky. Instability was adequate for tornadoes and severe storms in the presence of very strong wind shear. A very moist air mass resulted in heavy rainfall, which produced localized flash flooding due to the water-logged ground. Locally 5 to 6 inches of rain had fallen over the previous week. Rainfall rates in these thunderstorms were locally one-half to one inch per hour."
24,122793,29,"Localized flash flooding and a couple of tornadoes occurred across southeast Missouri. A narrow swath of torrential rainfall occurred from Cape Girardeau southwest across Poplar Bluff, where water rescues were conducted. A surface low pressure center tracked rapidly north-northeast from Arkansas to the upper Mississippi Valley, dragging a warm front north across southeast Missouri. Instability was adequate for a couple tornadoes in the presence of very strong wind shear. A very moist air mass resulted in heavy rainfall, which produced localized flash flooding due to the water-logged ground. Most rivers experienced minor flooding."
25,122796,22,A cold front moved across Louisiana and into a humid and unstable air mass after midnight. This produced scattered thunderstorms with a few producing damage.
26,122807,28,"A few severe thunderstorms developed on the 22nd of January, with one of them producing an EF-1 tornado in Covington and Jones County."
27,122822,48,A cold front pushed through Southeast Texas and into a humid and unstable air mass. Showers and storms developed with one tornado occurring.
28,122968,48,"As a cold front stalled out across the South Plains during the afternoon hours of the 27th, scattered rain showers and thunderstorms developed south of the front. Underneath one of these developing thunderstorms near the frontal boundary, a landspout tornado formed in northern Terry County. This landspout was documented on social media near the intersection of Farm to Market Road 211 and US Highway 385."
29,123015,13,"A line of thunderstorms ahead of a strong cold front swept through north and central Georgia during the morning into the early afternoon. Despite only marginal instability, strong low and mid-level shear resulted in isolated reports of thunderstorm wind damage and a few brief tornadoes."
30,123057,6,"A warm plume of moist tropical air brought a very active period of weather to the area between the evening of March 20 and the evening of March 22. This resulted in widespread heavy rainfall across the area on March 21 and 22 which produced flooding at many locations with rock slides and debris flows closing several roads across the area. The most impacted areas being around Mariposa as a result of the Detwiler Fire burn scar and Springville as a result of the Pier Fire burn scar. In addition, thunderstorms developed during the afternoon of March 22 producing flash flooding at many locations as well as funnel clouds. A Flash Flood Emergency was issued for most of western Mariposa County where several buildings were flooded and some areas were evacuated. A small tornado briefly touched down near Dinuba in Tulare County. In addition, several feet of new snow fell above 9000 feet. Below the snow line, much of the Southern Sierra Nevada measured between 4 and 8 inches of rainfall while most of the San Joaquin Valley picked up between 1 and 3 inches of rainfall."
31,123082,28,"Showers and thunderstorms moved across the ArkLaMiss region during the evening of March 10th into the early morning hours of March 11th. These came ahead of a cold front and intensifying low pressure system. Large hail occurred with these storms, especially in the ArkLaMiss Delta region, but wind damage also occurred into central Mississippi."
32,123140,47,"An intense storm system brought severe thunderstorms to northwest Middle Tennessee during the late afternoon and evening hours on February 24. One supercell thunderstorm developed along a warm front that moved northward across the area during the afternoon, spawning one tornado along the Kentucky/Tennessee border in Robertson County that then moved northeast into Kentucky. Later in the evening, a Quasi-Linear Convective System (QLCS) moved into the area from the west, spawning three more tornadoes across Montgomery and Robertson Counties which damaged dozens of homes and businesses and caused millions of dollars in damage. The QLCS also caused wind damage in several other counties."
33,123182,47,A strong cold front interacted with a very unstable airmass across the Midsouth during the afternoon and evening hours of February 24h. All facets of severe weather occurred.
34,123183,5,A strong cold front interacted with a very unstable airmass across the Midsouth during the afternoon and evening hours of February 24h. All facets of severe weather occurred.
35,123210,21,"A strong low pressure system tracked through the Ohio Valley on April 3. Ahead of it, very warm and moist air surged into the region with highs around 80 degrees. As a cold front swept through, lines of strong to severe thunderstorms brought damaging wind gusts and two short-lived tornadoes to central Kentucky. There were several pockets of intense straight line wind damage."
36,123251,48,"A cold front moved into a warm, very moist airmass over South Central Texas and generated thunderstorms. Some of these storms produced large hail and heavy rain. The heavy rain led to localized flash flooding. Rainfall totals in worst hit counties ranged from 4.09 to 5.72 inches."
37,123279,22,"A strong cold front moved through southern Mississippi, southeast Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters during the late night hours of the 6th and morning hours of the 7th. Severe thunderstorms developed in advance of the cold front with at least one tornado reported."
38,123309,29,Isolated strong to severe storms moved through the region. One tornado and isolated wind damage occurred.
39,123388,6,"A brief landspout tornado formed north of Bishop, CA.  There were multiple independent reports with video."
40,123391,22,A line of thunderstorms moved across the region producing an isolated tornado at Pitkin in Vernon Parish.
41,123403,29,A strong cold front and associated spring storm system produce severe thunderstorms with very large hail and several tornadoes across the Missouri Ozarks.
42,123407,12,"A line of strong to severe thunderstorms associated with a cold front moved across the area during the morning hours of April 15th.  A strong low level jet enhanced low level shear across the area, and a brief tornado occurred near Tyndall AFB in addition to numerous reports of trees down across northwest Florida."
43,123408,13,"A line of strong to severe thunderstorms associated with a cold front moved across the area during the morning hours of April 15th.  A strong low level jet enhanced low level shear across the area, and a brief tornado occurred in Decatur county, GA in addition to numerous reports of trees down across southern Georgia."
44,123419,29,A strong cold front interacted with a very unstable airmass across the Midsouth during the afternoon and evening hours of February 24h. All facets of severe weather occurred.
45,123441,37,"A strong cold front with a negatively-tilted upper level trough approached the North Carolina Piedmont.  Plenty of wind shear with modest instability made conditions ripe for large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes.  A supercell ahead of the cold front became strong enough to produce two tornadoes.  The first tornado initially formed in Guilford County but crossed into Rockingham County and caused noteworthy damage, while a second tornado touched down in Caswell County and continued into Virginia."
46,123442,51,"A strong cold front with a negatively-tilted upper level trough approached southwest Virginia.  Plenty of wind shear with modest instability made conditions ripe for large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes.  The thunderstorms ahead of the cold front became strong enough to produce six tornadoes across portions of southwest Virginia.  While the first tornado originally formed in Caswell County of North Carolina and crossed into Virginia, the other five all touched down in Virginia.  These tornadoes caused significant damage within the cities of Danville and Lynchburg and within the town of Elon in Amherst County.  It is the first time ever since storm data records began in 1950 that a tornado struck inside the city limits of Lynchburg."
47,123494,5,"Numerous supercell thunderstorms moved across Arkansas from the evening of April 13th into the early morning hours of April 14th. These storms produced multiple weak tornadoes and damaging wind gusts across Arkansas. The tornadoes and damaging wind gusts produced primarily light structural damage, and one of the hardest hit areas was a nursing home near Mountain Home that was heavily damaged by 85 mph straight line winds."
48,123495,45,"A strong upper level disturbance combined with strong atmospheric shear, and instability enhanced by diurnal heating, produced a line of thunderstorms, some of which were severe and included embedded tornadoes."
49,123499,13,"An upper-level short wave sweeping southeast through the southern Appalachians spawned isolated severe thunderstorms across the region. Cold air aloft, associated with the short wave, produced large hail in portions of north and central Georgia. Enhanced shear along a warm front helped to produced an isolated tornado in northeast Georgia."
50,123500,13,"Widespread severe thunderstorms broke out across central and north Georgia during the evening hours of March 19th, through the early morning hours of the 20th as a warm front lifted north across the region ahead of a strong storm system developing across the lower Mississippi Valley."
51,123518,5,"A line of thunderstorms moved through Arkansas on February 24th, bringing damaging winds, flash flooding, and a small tornado to Arkansas."
52,123528,28,"An unstable airmass and advancing cold front produced severe thunderstorms capable of large hail, damaging winds and a tornado across portions of north Mississippi during the morning and late afternoon hours of March 19th."
53,123573,39,Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes developed ahead of a strong cold front. Between one to three inches of rain fell across the region.
54,123615,22,"A cold front shifted south and became stationary across portions of Deep East Texas and the southern and eastern sections of Northcentral Louisiana during the afternoon hours of March 28th. A warm and unstable air mass was present near and south of the front, as a large upper level trough shifted east across Texas during the evening and overnight hours, taking on a negative tilt as it entered the region late. Showers and thunderstorms developed throughout the day on March 28th across much of East Texas and North Louisiana ahead of this trough, with surface low pressure developing along the front over Northcentral Louisiana. The combined instability and increased wind shear near and south of the front resulted in severe thunderstorm development, producing numerous reports of damaging winds and and a couple of isolated tornadoes during the afternoon. Additional thunderstorms intensified during the evening and overnight hours along and south of the front ahead of the approaching upper trough, with periods of heavy rainfall training over the same areas, resulting in flash flooding over portions of Northcentral Louisiana. These storms diminished during the early morning hours of March 29th with the passage of the trough."
55,123662,1,"Widespread showers and thunderstorms ahead of a cold front lifted northward across the tri-state area on Sunday, April 22, 2018. While overall damage reports with the thunderstorms were limited, strong low level shear caused rotation in numerous storms. Despite the strong low level shear, instability was limited and the resultant storm mode was mini-supercells.  A few reports of trees and even a downed street sign were reported in Houston county, AL. Despite the low-topped convection, the core of one storm in Lanier county, GA was also strong enough to produce nickel sized hail. While rotation was noted in multiple storms and a few tornado warnings were issued, only one storm produced a tornado that moved through Dale county, AL."
56,123664,1,"A brief, weak tornado touched down near Chatom and caused minor damage."
57,123683,1,"A line of thunderstorms moved across Central Alabama during the early morning hours of Wednesday, February 7, 2018. Supercells embedded within the line were responsible for producing large hail, damaging winds, and several tornadoes. Severe weather was not anticipated as most model guidance indicated insufficient instability and wind shear for the development of supercells, tornadoes and other severe convective hazards. Even so, a marginal risk was highlighted for the western and southern portions of Central Alabama. The storms exhibited organization and frequent lightning, indicators that instability was likely higher than expected. The radar signatures were marginal at best and therefore, only a few Severe Thunderstorm Warnings were issued during the event."
58,123684,39,"A warm front lifted across the middle Ohio River Valley on the morning of the 3rd. This brought a round of showers and thunderstorms. Showers lingered across central and eastern Ohio through much of the day with the warm front in the vicinity. A strong cold front then pushed through in the evening with strong to severe thunderstorms. Periods of heavy rain, first with the warm front, and then again with the cold front led to flooding."
59,123730,17,"An outbreak of severe thunderstorms occurred during the afternoon and evening. Several tornadoes were spawned along a line of fast-moving thunderstorms. Four of the tornadoes were associated with a persistent circulation that moved east across Williamson and Saline Counties, passing just north of Marion and Harrisburg. The circulation exited southern Illinois along the Wabash River southeast of Carmi. A fifth tornado was associated with a circulation that tracked east across Massac and Pope Counties in the southern tip of the state.  The severe storm outbreak occurred ahead of a cold front that accelerated east-southeast toward the mid Mississippi Valley. Cooling aloft ahead of a shortwave trough over the Plains, combined with diurnal heating and moist southerly winds, resulted in a corridor of deepening convection ahead of the front. Steep mid-level lapse rates and strong effective wind shear promoted some large hail within the strongest storms."
60,123737,21,"Clusters of strong to severe thunderstorms moved eastward out of southern Illinois and southeast Missouri. The storms produced four tornadoes over the far western counties of Kentucky before weakening as they moved east across the Kentucky Lake region. The most significant tornado, which occurred over Livingston County, was rated EF-2. The severe storms occurred ahead of a cold front that accelerated east-southeast toward the lower Ohio Valley. Cooling aloft ahead of a shortwave trough over the Plains, combined with diurnal heating and moist southerly winds, resulted in a corridor of  convection ahead of the front. The storms weakened somewhat as they moved east across the Kentucky Lake region into slightly drier and more stable air."
61,123749,42,"Waves of heavy rain produced flooding on February 15th through the 16th. A line of thunderstorms developed along a lifting warm front, providing not only for enhancement in the rainfall totals, which ranged from 1-3 inches, but also attributed to shear that supported the development of a short-lived tornado over Uniontown, in Fayette county Pennsylvania. This was the first tornado in February since 1950 for the Pittsburgh Weather Service area of responsibility."
62,123764,12,"A strong squall line moved into the west coast of Florida ahead of a fast moving cold front. Some of the stronger storms produced severe wind gusts, and one waterspout came onshore as a brief lived tornado."
63,123813,22,"A warm front lifted north across much of East Texas and Southwest Arkansas by the afternoon hours on April 6th, with very warm, humid, and unstable air having spread in place across much of the Ark-La-Tex during the afternoon and evening hours. In addition to the surface based instability in place, very cold temperatures in the mid and upper level of the atmosphere resulted in very steep lapse rates further enhancing instability, with strong wind shear present in advance of a strong cold front which entered the Southern Plains during the afternoon ahead of a strong upper level trough of low pressure. Scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along and just in advance of the cold front, many of which became severe producing large hail and damaging winds. These storms steadily marched east across North Louisiana during the mid afternoon through much of the evening hours before diminishing late with the passage of the cold front and upper trough."
64,123836,22,"A deep upper level low pressure and an associated cold front produced a line of thunderstorms that moved across southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi and the adjacent coastal waters during the morning and afternoon hours of the 14th. Several reports of tornadoes were received from these storms."
65,123837,28,"A deep upper level low pressure and an associated cold front produced a line of thunderstorms that moved across southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi and the adjacent coastal waters during the morning and afternoon hours of the 14th. Several reports of tornadoes were received from these storms."
66,123838,22,A cold front moved across southeast Louisiana during the morning hours of the 22nd. The thunderstorms associated with the cold front produced at least one tornado near Galliano.
67,123852,22,A line of thunderstorms moved through the region during the evening of March 28. These storms brought tornadoes as well as straight line winds to portions of northeast Louisiana in association with a cold front passing through the region.
68,123853,28,A line of thunderstorms moved through the region during the evening of March 28. These storms brought tornadoes as well as large hail and straight line winds to portions of central Mississippi in association with a cold front passing through the region.
69,123876,12,"A small shower moved onshore during the evening hours, producing a brief tornado over Ruskin."
70,123905,22,"A strong upper level trough of low pressure progressed east across the Southern Plains during the afternoon of April 13th, with a large warm sector of warm/humid air having expanded north across much of the Ark-La-Tex. A capping inversion delayed the onset of thunderstorm development until the late afternoon, where it eroded and large scale forcing increased with shortwave perturbations ahead of the trough and along/just ahead of a dry line as it mixed east to the Interstate 35 corridor or North and Central Texas. Given the moderate instability and strong wind shear that developed with the lead shortwave, scattered supercell thunderstorms developed across Northcentral Louisiana during the late afternoon through mid evening hours, producing numerous reports of damaging winds, and several tornadoes/funnel cloud reports. While a lull in the storms was observed, a line of severe thunderstorms developed along the dryline south of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, and progressed east into East Texas by late evening, and across North Louisiana after midnight on April 14th. Damaging winds and reports of hail were prevalent at first with this line of severe thunderstorms, but a number of notches developed along the squall line as these storms crossed into North Louisiana, resulting in several tornadoes touching down across areas along and north of the Interstate 20 corridor from Shreveport to Monroe. Of particular interest, the initial string of tornadoes first touched down just west of the Texas/Louisiana state line along the Harrison/Panola County line, with this supercell producing two separate tornadoes as it entered Shreveport. In fact, the tornado remained on the ground across much of western and central Shreveport, moving across the northern fringes of the property at the National Weather Service Office before moving across the Queensborough and Allendale neighborhoods and across Downtown Shreveport, before tracking across much of Bossier City along and just north of Interstate 20, crossing Interstate 220, and across the Red Chute and Princeton communities before lifting just west of the Bossier/Webster Parish line. These severe thunderstorms exited North Louisiana just after 3 am on the 14th."
71,123907,29,"An organized outbreak of severe thunderstorms occurred. Most of the severe weather reports were generated by two intense storm clusters. The first cluster crossed the Ozark foothills between Van Buren and Doniphan, then proceeded due east across Poplar Bluff and Dexter to the Mississippi River. This cluster occasionally acquired supercell characteristics. Large hail from 1 to 3 inches in diameter was common during most of its life cycle in southeast Missouri. A couple of tornadoes were spawned as well. A second less intense cluster moved east across southern Bollinger and Cape Girardeau Counties. This cluster produced hail up to the size of golf balls and an isolated wind gust up to near 60 mph. The severe storm outbreak occurred ahead of a  cold front that accelerated east-southeast toward the mid Mississippi Valley. Cooling aloft ahead of a shortwave trough over the Plains, combined with diurnal heating and moist southerly winds, resulted in a corridor of deepening convection ahead of the front. Steep mid-level lapse rates and strong effective wind shear promoted some very large hail within discrete storm cells."
72,123927,12,A frontal boundary moved into the region which allowed scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms to develop. In the moist and unstable air mass a thunderstorm developed and produced a tornado along outflow and boundary interactions.
73,123931,20,"On the evening of May 2, 2018 a line of strong storms moved through eastern Kansas. While strong storms occurred across the entire eastern part of the state, the strongest impacts were felt within the Kansas City Metro area, where a EF-1 tornado formed in Overland Park, causing a fair amount of damage in the form of widespread tree damage, some structure damage to local schools, and numerous power lines and power poles were destroyed. The line of storms continued into western Missouri, where they went on to produce more tornadoes and scattered wind damage."
74,123932,29,"On the evening of May 2, 2018 strong thunderstorms moved out of Kansas and into western Missouri. These storms formed squall line tornadoes, that did damage across portions of the Kansas City Metro Area. The bulk of the damage occurred in Jackson County, Kansas, where several trees were destroyed in the Raytown area near and along Raytown Road. Two tornadoes occurred that night in Raytown causing a narrow path of tree damage, which also caused some structure damage.  Several other areas had some tornado and wind damage, although not quite as extensive. Several areas had trees blown down with some damage done to objects they fell onto."
75,123943,20,Supercell T-storms developed across north central Kansas during the late afternoon on May 1.  The supercells produced at least 4 documented tornadoes including a strong tornado in Ottawa county near Tescott Kansas.  No injuries occurred with any of the storms.
76,123946,20,A large cluster of t-storms developed during the afternoon of May 2 across central Kansas.

80,124002,48,"A strong upper level trough of low pressure progressed east across the Southern Plains during the afternoon of April 13th, with a large warm sector of warm/humid air having expanded north across much of the Ark-La-Tex. A capping inversion delayed the onset of thunderstorm development until the late afternoon, where it eroded and large scale forcing increased with shortwave perturbations ahead of the trough and along/just ahead of a dry line as it mixed east to the Interstate 35 corridor or North and Central Texas. Given the moderate instability and strong wind shear that developed with the lead shortwave, scattered supercell thunderstorms developed across East Texas during the late afternoon through the evening hours, producing numerous reports of damaging winds and large hail. While a lull in the storms was observed, a line of severe thunderstorms developed along the dryline south of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, and progressed east into East Texas by late evening. Damaging winds and reports of hail were prevalent at first with this line of severe thunderstorms, but a number of notches developed along the squall line as these storms moved into extreme Eastern Texas, resulting in two tornadoes touching down across Northern Gregg and Northwest Harrison Counties, as well as extreme Southeastern Harrison County near the Caddo Parish Louisiana line. These severe thunderstorms exited East Texas by midnight on the 14th."

94,124244,48,"During the early evening hours on March 28th, isolated severe thunderstorms developed across northern Mexico and Deep South Texas. Storms formed within an environment of very unstable air and very strong vertical wind shear in advance of an approaching cold front with assistance from an approaching upper level disturbance. Severe storms occurred across the Brush Country during the evening. The storms congealed into a squall line late in the evening. Large hail and winds of at least 60 mph were observed with several of these storms across the Brush Country. During the early morning hours on March 29th, the squall line intensified as it advanced into the Coastal Bend and the Victoria area. Widespread winds between 40 and 60 mph were observed behind the squall line during this time. Sufficient low level shear in the lowest several thousand feet existed to produce mesovortices along the squall line. Several of these mesovortices produced tornadoes across the Coastal Bend during the early morning hours."

96,124292,5,"During the evening hours of Friday, April 13th, scattered supercells developed across northeast Louisiana within the broad warm sector of a strong surface cyclone centered near the Kansas/Nebraska border. These storms exhibited rotation almost immediately, and began producing tornadoes across northern Louisiana. Two tornadoes occurred in the NWS Jackson forecast area in association with a cell that tracked from near Rayville, LA north northeastward along the Boeuf River. These storms also produced strong wind as they continued into southeast Arkansas. Overnight, as the cold front associated with the storm system began to advance eastward, a quasi-linear convective system developed over the ArkLaTex and advanced eastward. These storms reached the western portion of the NWS Jackson forecast area after 2:30 am on Saturday, April 14th.

101,124323,32,"A closed upper level low situated across northern Nevada produced isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms on May 11th, 2018. The showers and thunderstorms produced two separate tornadoes. The first tornado occurred south of Interstate 80 near Golconda in an open field. The second tornado touched down north of Golconda off U.S. Highway 95 and crossed a dirt road. No damage was observed."
102,124326,12,"The interaction between a strengthening low pressure system in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Bermuda High caused south winds to develop across the Florida peninsula. These winds brought a surge of moisture from the Caribbean across the state of Florida. A weak inverted trough/low pressure system developed in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, this in turn increased the low-level shear across much of east central Florida. Widespread showers and thunderstorms were ongoing throughout the day. One thunderstorm just offshore the Brevard County Coast became strong and developed a mesocyclone. This storm produced a waterspout that moved onshore and produced minor damage on Merritt Island. A second storm over inland Martin County developed a mesocyclone and produced a weak tornado, resulting in minor damage near Indiantown."

105,124364,48,Severe storms erupted along the dryline during the late afternoon and continued into the  early morning hours of May 3rd.  The storms resulted in several reports of damaging winds and large hail across West Central Texas.
106,124409,17,"Low pressure tracking across central Illinois triggered a line of fast-moving thunderstorms during the afternoon of April 3rd.  The storms primarily impacted locations south of the I-72 corridor, with one cell embedded within the line producing an EF-1 tornado in southern Effingham County.  Thunderstorms earlier in the day dropped locally heavy rainfall of 3-5 inches across portions of Coles County, including 3.76 in Charelston.  Due to excessive rainfall rates over a short period of time, flash flooding occurred in the Charleston-Mattoon area.  Numerous roads were closed due to high water, including IL-16 between Mattoon and Charleston.  Several homes had to be evacuated and water rescues took place in a neighborhood on the south side of Mattoon."
107,124410,1,"Six tornadoes and hail up to 3 inches in diameter affected the northern areas of Central Alabama on the afternoon and evening hours of March 19th, with a rare PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) Tornado Watch issued for a large portion of Central Alabama. An environment favorable for significant severe thunderstorms developed as a low-amplitude upper-level trough moved into the region with a deepening surface low passing across far north Alabama.  These two features resulted in a deep column of strong wind shear with 0-6km Bulk Shear values of 60-70 knots. Additionally, moist southerly flow, warm surface temperatures, and colder temperatures aloft yielded a moderately unstable air mass. Initially, thunderstorms were producing large to very large hail. However, the tornado threat increased in the late afternoon and evening hours as wind speeds at low levels increased with the arrival of a low-level jet."
108,124416,42,"An EF1 tornado was confirmed near Enola, Cumberland County, by a NWS storm survey. Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 90 mph, with a path length of approximately 200 yards and a maximum path width of 40 yards."
109,124447,35,"A deep fetch of moisture surged north and west into New Mexico on May 21, 2018 ahead of an upper level low pressure system approaching from Arizona. The combination of strong afternoon heating and moist instability allowed showers and thunderstorms to develop along the Continental Divide during the mid to late morning hours of the 21st. Hail, high winds, and funnel clouds were reported along the Continental Divide before spreading northeastward into the Rio Grande Valley during the early afternoon. A cluster of thunderstorms that developed just southwest of the Albuquerque Metro Area around 3 pm dumped copious amounts of hail and torrential rainfall across the city. Some parts of Albuquerque reported up to one inch of rain in less than 20 minutes. One woman was killed and five others injured when they were swept away in the urban drainage system designed to carry flood waters. These storms shifted east into the high plains of eastern New Mexico through the late afternoon and evening hours with more widespread severe weather. The Raton area also saw copious amounts of hail and heavy rainfall. Lincoln County was particularly hard hit with large hail up to the size of golf balls. Hail accumulated to at least one foot east of Alto as several severe storms moved over the same area. A funnel cloud was also spotted to the northeast of Ruidoso Downs. Heavy rainfall and small hail spread eastward into the plains through the overnight hours where many parts of eastern New Mexico picked up between one and two inches of rainfall."
110,124450,35,"For a third day in a row, and potentially the most widespread, severe weather impacted eastern New Mexico on May 23, 2018 as a strong dry line shifted east across the high plains. Showers and thunderstorms fired up just east of the central mountain chain by the mid to late afternoon hours then moved eastward on to the high plains through the early evening. A very impressive supercell storm over far southwestern Chaves County produced two tornadoes and large hail. Other storms in the area also produced severe hail and funnel clouds before merging into a large cluster of strong storms near Roswell. Another very impressive, long duration supercell storm over western San Miguel County produced torrential rainfall, flooding, high winds, and very large hail near Tecolotito and Anton Chico. Several other storms across the eastern plains were strong to severe with heavy rain, hail, and high winds."
111,124462,27,"A series of thunderstorms developed Friday afternoon along a cold front, amidst a moisture rich air mass. Another area of storms developed across the eastern Dakotas, and raced eastward across central, and southern Minnesota. The storms along the front produced a weak landspout tornado near Minnesota Lake. Other storms produced marginal severe hail in the northwest part of the Twin Cities, with larger hail, up to golf ball size, west of Albert Lea."
112,124503,6,"Torrential rain from an atmospheric river with locally heavy convective showers brought flash flooding to portions of the northern Sierra and Motherlode foothills. The heaviest flooding was in Groveland, where 4-5 of rain fell, combining with 8-9 of rain in higher elevations upstream. There was also widespread damage in Tuolumne County to roads from debris flows, soil erosion, erosion of water conveyance systems, sewer systems that were inundated with excess water and debris. Roads damaged inluded state Highways 49 and 132. Moccasin Dam was damaged and came close to failure, with  road closures. A tornado struck an amphitheater in Wheatland and caused minor damage. Heavy snow caused travel problems over Sierra highways."
113,124573,8,"Severe thunderstorms formed the afternoon of Memorial Day.  Fourteen tornadoes were observed by spotters and chasers in the afternoon.  A rare sighting of a tornado was reported from Jackson County.  Some of the strongest storms formed across northeast Colorado, along a surface convergence boundary. The boundary extended from Kit Carson County north into Washington County, and then through Morgan and Weld counties. Intense convection that developed right on top of the boundary generated several tornadoes, with a few occurring simultaneously, especially across extreme southeast Washington County. Most of the tornadoes touched down in open fields and produced just minor crop damage. The heaviest damage occurred in Cope, in southeast Washington County, from an EF-1 tornado.  It caused extensive damage to a carport and garage on the southeast side of town, and downed some trees. The storms also produced hail up to the size of tennis balls in Washington County.  Further west, across the foothills west of Denver and across metro Denver,  instability was weaker and marginally severe hail occurred, including accumulating hail across the south metro Denver."
114,124592,19,"For a third consecutive day, a boundary found itself draped from NE to SW roughly cutting the state of Iowa in half.  Similar afternoon conditions resulted as well with 1000 - 2000 J/kg MUCAPE, little CIN, and borderline to good effective bulk shear around 30 to 40 kts and pushing 50 kts at times.  With storms more closely rooted to the boundary, low level helicity in excess of 150 m2/s2 raised at least some concern for tornadoes. After a few initial discrete cells, storms eventually congealed into a progressive QLCS that moved across central Iowa and produced 3 weak tornadoes just east of the Des Moines metro area along with a few reports of wind damage and sub-severe hail."
115,124604,5,"A line of strong to severe thunderstorms moved into northwestern Arkansas during the early morning hours of the 3rd, producing isolated wind damage. Another line of storms developed over far eastern Oklahoma during the early afternoon as a cold front moved into the area. These storms moved across northwestern Arkansas producing a tornado and damaging wind gusts."
116,124615,12,"The Florida peninsula experienced strong south to southeast flow with Subtropical Storm Alberto far to the west and a strong high pressure over the western Atlantic. These south winds allowed deep tropical moisture from the Caribbean to move across the Florida peninsula. Some mid-level dry air wrapped itself around the eastern side of Alberto's circulation, which decreased cloud cover across parts of central Florida allowing for daytime heating and instability to increase. Scattered showers and thunderstorms developed during the afternoon and moved towards the coast. One storm became severe in Martin County where it produced a short-lived, weak tornado (landspout)."
117,124616,39,Scattered thunderstorms developed across the region as the remnants of Sub Tropical Storm Alberto lifted north through the Ohio Valley.
118,124621,20,A brief tornado occurred in Belleville Kansas around 815pm CDT.  Only minor tree limb damage was reported by EM along with power lines that were brought down by tree limbs. Radar and assessment of near storm environmental parameters suggest that this could have been a brief weak tornado.
119,124656,40,"Severe thunderstorms developed during the afternoon of the 19th along a stationary front that extended across northern Oklahoma. The storms formed over north central Oklahoma and then moved through eastern Oklahoma producing two tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large hail up to golfball size."
120,124740,31,"Severe storms produced numerous reports of hail and 3 brief, weak tornadoes on this Tuesday afternoon and evening. Between 230 and 330 PM CST, scattered fairly small supercell thunderstorms developed along a line from Red Cloud to Grand Island to Columbus. They were not mini-supercells, though, as cloud tops were near 40,000 ft. The storms generally remained along that line except for one storm that moved east into Clay County and another small multicell cluster that moved east along the Nebraska-Kansas border. Nearly 30 occurrences of severe hail were reported with most of between the sizes of quarters and golf balls. The largest hail reported was 2 inches in diameter in the town of Roseland. Three brief EF-0 tornadoes also occurred. The storms from Grand Island to Columbus formed along a slow-moving cold front. One tornado was associated with a supercell located on or very close to the front just west of Aurora. Another tornado formed near Doniphan as a north-northeastward-moving storm crossed the front. The third tornado occurred with the storm that moved east along the Nebraska-Kansas border. This storm evolved from a small bow echo and exhibited a spiral shape as it produced a brief tornado near Chester. The storms dissipated or moved out of south central Nebraska by 6 PM CST.||A low pressure system was near Lake Superior with a slow-moving cold front extending southwest across Nebraska to the Oklahoma Panhandle. In the upper-levels, southwest flow covered most of the U.S., with a trough over the West and a ridge over the Northeast. Just prior to thunderstorm development, temperatures were in the lower 80s with dewpoints in the upper 50s to near 60. With mid-level lapse rates near 8 C/km, MLCAPE was 2000-2500 J/kg. Deep layer shear was 40-50 kts, which was more than sufficient for supercell convective mode."
121,124741,20,"Storms produced very heavy rain, localized hail and wind damage, and even a brief tornado over north central Kansas on this Tuesday afternoon and evening. Around 2 PM CST, several thunderstorms rapidly developed southwest-to-northeast across Rooks and Smith counties. These storms merged into a line as they moved east and gradually evolved into two multicell clusters. Each cluster tracked across portions of Jewell, and Osborne and Mitchell counties. The Jewell County storm become a very small bow echo, but with no wind damage reported. However, some wind damage did occur over southeastern Osborne County where wood framing and metal sheeting were blown off an outbuilding on one farm. A hay rake and two empty grain trailers were also blown over. Hail occurred in many places, with the largest 2 inches in diameter over south central Mitchell County. This same storm produced a brief tornado that resembled an elephant trunk. As these storms moved into northeast Kansas, other storms continued to initiate near Interstate 70 and began lifting into southern Osborne and Mitchell counties after 6 PM CST. The axis of storms stopped lifting north and repeated storm development occurred over southern Osborne and Mitchell counties, between 7 and 11 PM CST, resulting in total rainfall amounts between 2.50 and 5.18 inches. The highest amount of 5.18 inches fell just southeast of Tipton. Flash flooding occurred in low-lying spots from southeast Osborne across central Mitchell counties, with water over multiple county roads. Flooding resulted in a washout where bridge work was being performed in Mitchell county on Victor road, between P and Q roads.||A low pressure system was near Lake Superior with a slow-moving cold front extending southwest across Kansas to the Oklahoma Panhandle. In the upper-levels, southwest flow covered most of the U.S., with a trough over the West and a ridge over the Northeast.

138,125220,45,Scattered to numerous afternoon thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold front from late morning through the afternoon across Upstate South Carolina. Several of the storms produced severe weather in the form of large hail and locally damaging winds.
139,125263,17,"Multiple rounds of thunderstorms impacted the region on the last day of May. Damaging winds, large hail, flooding, and a couple tornadoes were observed in this outbreak. The first round of storms moved through southern Illinois, mainly north of Route 13, during the morning hours. Widespread damaging winds were associated with this line of storms. Scattered thunderstorm development then began by mid to late afternoon, with coverage increasing further into the evening hours. The first round of storms left an outflow boundary across southeast Missouri and the lower Ohio Valley, where scattered thunderstorms developed. Surface dewpoints near the boundary were in the lower 70s, which contributed to moderately strong instability. A subtle shortwave trough across the mid Mississippi Valley and lower Missouri Valley provided large-scale ascent for the evening round of storms. Mid-level winds around 50 knots located just ahead of the shortwave helped to create moderate to strong deep-layer wind shear, favorable for a few supercells."

149,125554,31,"Severe thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold front moving slowly southeast across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  Supercell thunderstorms produced hail as large as 4 inches in diameter in Butler County, and thunderstorm winds as high 80 mph near Wymore,NE.  A tornado briefly touched down near Odell in Gage County.  Heavy rainfall in some of the storms caused water to go over roads in Butler County and Burt County."
150,125626,51,"Warm and humid conditions had been in place for several days leading up to this event. A weak upper level system passed through the region, sparking showers and thunderstorms, mainly during the afternoon and evening hours. One storm did spin up a brief and weak tornado."
151,125637,37,"A strong upper low moved from Iowa across the Lower Great Lakes region, with a deep trough taking on a negative tilt while swinging into North Carolina. An associated strong cold front approached western North Carolina that afternoon and pushed east and east-northeast across central North Carolina on the night of the 15th. A strengthening and backing flow at all levels led to a surge of moisture into NC. Moderate instability, strong deep layer shear, and high low-level storm-relative helicity were also present. The result was a quasi-linear convective system with embedded mesovortices, which produced widespread severe weather, including a tornado in Greensboro, as it moved through North Carolina."

159,125794,12,"A fast-moving pre-frontal squall line passing through the upper Florida Keys developed an embedded supercell thunderstorm with attendant mesocyclone along the Florida Bay side of Upper Matecumbe Key.  The supercell thunderstorm moved east-northeast, producing a waterspout which made landfall on the bayside of Plantation Key, Islamorada.  The tornado crossed the Overseas Highway, exiting oceanside just southwest of Tavernier Creek.  The waterspout then made a second landfall oceanside in Tavernier southeast of Tavernier Creek before dissipating."
160,125795,38,"Discrete storms developed initially ahead of a strong shortwave in moderate instability and shear. The initial storms produced large hail and several funnel clouds along with three short-lived tornadoes, one in Morton County, one in Stark, and one in Dunn County. There was no damage with the three tornadoes and so they were all rated EF0. Additional storm growth then occurred, forming into a small mesoscale convective system with large hail and strong wind gusts as the main threats. The largest hail was half-dollar size, and fell in both Hettinger and Dunn Counties. The strongest wind gusts of 75 mph occurred in Morton and Rolette counties."
161,125810,19,"A juicy air mass was in place across the region with highs into the mid 90s and dew points into the mid 60s to low 70s. Resulting SB and MUCAPE values were in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg values. Other supporting factors for sustained severe storms were relatively lacking with little effective helicity to speak of, let alone effective shear. DCAPE, however, was fairly robust in the 1400-1700 J/kg range.  Additionally, a weak north-south boundary was laid up across western Iowa that saw a brief landspout near Plover during initial development of storms. Overall, the majority of reports through central and northern Iowa were severe hail and winds from short-lived convection."
162,125811,19,"General surface high pressure remained in the region, keeping the area hot. With moisture off the from remnants of Alberto and general southerly flow down to the Gulf of Mexico, moisture was fairly plentiful with surface dew points in the mid to upper 60s. Support for sustained severe weather was fairly lackluster, with limited hail CAPE, negligible effective shear, but overall SBCAPE values did exceed 3000 to 4000 J/kg. DCAPE values were relatively high in excess of 1000 to 1200 J/kg, raising concern for strong downdrafts/microbursts.  ||Lingering convection from western Kansas the day before slowly worked towards western Iowa in the morning hours as waves ejected from a western upper level trough. Additionally, weak warm air advection aided initial storm initiation across the western half of Iowa ahead of the larger wave moving off the Rockies. Initially, numerous storms were seen by early afternoon with most being sub-severe. Outflows form early storms also proceeded to initiate subsequent storms, eventually congealing briefly into a linear looking structure. Nearly all severe reports received were wind related from microbursts and collapsing storms as well as one landspout near Ames. Power outages occurred with the storms with at over 9,000 customers without power at one time or another between Ames and Des Moines."

167,126015,20,"During the late afternoon and well into the evening, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms formed over Northwest Kansas.  The storm coverage and intensity increased during the early evening.  The strongest storms were located near an old outflow boundary.  The largest hail reported was baseball size, with one report near Herndon and two other reports near Quinter.  Thunderstorm winds broke tree limbs three to four inches in diameter northeast of Atwood.  Due to repeated rainfall over Herndon and Quinter, flash flooding occurred.  A weak tornado was reported south of Tasco near the Gove County line with a developing thunderstorm, the same storm that produced baseball size hail near Quinter."
168,126088,40,"An active day of severe weather across the Panhandles. The main 500-300 mb synoptic pattern the morning into the afternoon of the 28th showed an upper level low pressure moving through the central Rockies with an embedded jet streak rounding the base of the upper level low pressure across portions of Arizona and New Mexico. This resulted in a large region of favorable ascent with high mid level lapse rates above 8 C/km across the northern Panhandles in the left exit region of the jet streak. A surface dryline also developed across the western Panhandles where good surface based directional shear was established along this boundary of SE winds ahead of the dryline vs. SW to westerly behind the boundary. Ahead of the dryline, 850-700 mb moisture surged northward with good 20-30 kts mean southerly wind flow to further enhance the gradient setup across the dryline. Morning sounding profiles did show some cap, but with good heating during the day, thunderstorms eventually developed along the dryline. With sufficient SBCAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg, effective shear of 30-40 kts, and good CAPE in the hail growth zone given low freezing levels, storms developed in multi cell clusters. Individual cells did have a strong updraft to produce hail sizes that maxed out around 3 in diameter; along with damaging winds gusts/reports. Thunderstorms across the northern and central half of the cluster did eventually cluster up to form line segments. With the daytime heating still in place into the early evening hours, coupled with 0-1 km SRH values around 200 m2/s2, enough low level rotation did drop 2 tornadoes across Texas County, OK with an EF-0 and EF-1 rating. Storms remained mostly cellular on the southern segment of storms where large hail and strong rotating thunderstorms continued into the late evening hours across the eastern Panhandles before the storms exiting east of the region during the overnight hours."
169,126090,48,"Dryline setup across the eastern Panhandles in-conjunction with residual outflow boundaries from convection from the previous day set the stages for supercell development. SBCAPE values of 2000-3000 J/kg in a very favorable low level moisture environment ahead of the dryline along  with effective SRH of 100-200 m2/s2 due to good low level directional shear. Two supercells developed in the afternoon hours on the 29th in the eastern TX Panhandle. The northern storm became a left mover and produced hail up to golf balls with damaging wind gusts in the northeastern combined Panhandles before exiting the region. The right mover moved through the southeast TX Panhandle was a larger and stronger storm. This supercell had strong rotation and eventually dropped a tornado in two different locations in its path; both rated EF-0, along with very large hail up to 3 in diameter in the town of Wheeler."
